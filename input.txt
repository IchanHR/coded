This is a four unit CS course. As such, you should expect to spend 3 hours per week in lecture, 3 hours per week in lab, and 6 to 10 hours
per week doing individual study (readings, homeworks, programming, lab
preparation, etc) -- no exaggerating here! Please don't underestimate
the time you will need to spend on this course. These are real time
amounts spent by successful past students. Computer Science and
Engineering are challenging disciplines requiring extensive time to
master -- it's worth it in the end (great jobs, great pay, respect,
etc.), but those things don't come for free. So practice, practice,
practice! Work hard in school, then reap the rewards of a great
career.
